# Reddit Gen 2 UI Restoration

A userscript that partially restores the "feels" of Reddit's Generation 2 UI.

## ⚠️ Important Note
This script is designed to work specifically with Reddit's **Compact Layout**. Other layouts may not display correctly.

## Disclaimer
This script only implements the "feels" of Reddit's Gen 2 UI. Other features from the Gen 2 UI are not implemented because I don't really care and does not really use them.

I only tested this script on my own setup, so it might not work properly on your browser or Reddit settings.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)

2. [Click here to install the script](https://github.com/torikushiii/reddit-ui-restore/raw/refs/heads/main/reddit.user.js)

## Note

If you encounter some coloring issues, it may because community themes are enabled go here to disable them: https://www.reddit.com/settings/preferences

## Usage

1. Make sure you're using Reddit's Compact Layout
2. The script will automatically activate on Reddit pages
3. Communities can be accessed via the dropdown menu in the header
